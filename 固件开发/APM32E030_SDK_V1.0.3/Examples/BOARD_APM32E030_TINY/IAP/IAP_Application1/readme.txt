&par Example Description

This example shows how to generate a APP firmware to IAP.

LED2 are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

note:

Before using IAP function, you must download the bootloader program to the target board.
Then compile the "Application1" or "Application2" project, and update the generated bin
firmware file to the target board with the function of IAP through the HyperTerminal tool.
